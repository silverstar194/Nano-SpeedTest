      Nano is built for efficiency. The network utilizes minimal resources, resulting in the fastest transactions of any currency, while not sacrificing security. Lightweight, optimized nodes are run throughout the world to confirm transactions and require no mining, making Nano perfect for everyday transactions, no matter how large or small.

            It'll grow.
          </b>
        </li>
        The protocol is incredibly lightweight and will scale to thousands of transactions per second.

        </li>
        There is no 'mining'. One transaction takes only 0.001kWh. That's the equivalent of 1/13,000 the energy it takes to toast a slice of bread.
        <br />
        Other currencies consume thousands of times more energy.

      FAQ
    </h3>
    <h5>
      What is this site doing?
    </h5>
    What are timing the speed of a Nano transaction as it happens. Everytime you click the big green 'GO' button we send a small amount of money in the form of Nano between two locations worldwide and time how long it takes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h5>
      Technically, what do you record as the time? Isn't the network decentralized?
    </h5>
    Yes, the Nano network is decentralized so not all parts see transactions at the same time. We record four times:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Time we broadcast send block at location #1
      </li>
      <li>
        Time we see send block at location #2
      </li>
      <li>
        Time we broadcast receive block at location #2
      </li>
      <li>
        Time we see the receive block back at location #1
      </li>
    </ol>
    We time delta between 1 and 4 is the time you see displayed. This represents the time is takes to send AND pocket a transaction. Transactions are technically final and confirmed after step 2 or less then 10 seconds.

    <h5>
      What's a Nano node?
    </h5>
    Nano nodes broadcast transactions to the Nano network and keep the network secure by voting on transactions. They store and validate your transactions. Our nodes are physically located in data centers around the world.
